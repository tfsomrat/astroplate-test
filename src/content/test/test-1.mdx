ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and impact both help businesses assess and improve their effects on society and the environment. Though related, each focuses on different aspects of a business's risk management and influence.

ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, and it reflects the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an organisation. For small businesses, embracing ESG is not just about compliance—it's about driving growth, building trust, and staying competitive.
